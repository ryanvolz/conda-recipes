  summary: 'C++ library for flexible logging'
  description: |
    Log for C++ is a library of C++ classes for flexible logging to files,
    syslog and other destinations. It is modeled after the Log for Java library
    (http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/), staying as close to their API as is
    reasonable.
